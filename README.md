# pinsManifest

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of pinsManifest is to help with a particular use-case for
[pins]():

-   you create a board using `pins::board_folder()`
-   you serve the board using `pins::board_url()`

The mechanism is to make a *manifest* file that you can use to create a
`pins::board_url()`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of pinsManifest from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/pinsManifest")
```
