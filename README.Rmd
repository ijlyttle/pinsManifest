The goal of pinsManifest is to help with a particular use-case for [pins]():

 - you create a board using `pins::board_folder()`
 - you serve the board using `pins::board_url()`
 
The mechanism is to make a *manifest* file that you can use to create a `pins::board_url()`. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of pinsManifest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ijlyttle/pinsManifest")
```
